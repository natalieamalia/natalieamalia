# E0: MIS Intro

MIS has been a part of my life since before I began college. My dad graduated with a baccalaureate in MIS and has had a successful career in Project Management. I always admired his work and his success, even though I never fully understood it. I'm not the most tech-savvy person, and before I began my undergaduate studies at MƒÅnoa I had no intention of pursuing MIS. I spent my freshman year of college intending to become a Pychocology major. After taking a few business courses as electives, I decided that I should pursue business at Shidler. In my sophomore year of college I was an exploratory business student planning on studying Finance. One of the prerequisites that I took was an Information and Computer Systems course. This course was very eye-opening for me and really sparked my interest in information systems. After learning basic HTML codes and working with different databases, I realized that MIS was the degree for me. I have developed an interest in data analytics and networking. I also plan on declaring a double major in Finacne or Marketing so that I am qualified to use my MIS skills in a specific field. For now I'm just enjoying learning all there is to know about programming, information systems, and data analytics. I am excited for my future in MIS and look forward to working with everyone in ITM 352!
