# E0: MIS Intro

<p> MIS has been a part of my life since before I began college. My dad graduated with a baccalaureate in MIS and has had a successful career in Project Management. I always admired his work and his success in business. Although I thought his job was interesting, I did not think that I would follow the same career path. Growing up, I was never particularly interested in gaming or computers. In fact, before I began my undergaduate studies at MƒÅnoa, I had no intention of pursuing MIS. I spent my freshman year of college intending to become a Pychocology major. After taking a few business courses as electives, I decided that I should pursue business at Shidler. </p> 
<p> In my sophomore year of college I was an exploratory business student planning on studying Finance. One of the prerequisites that I took was an Information and Computer Systems course. This course was very eye-opening for me and really sparked my interest in information systems. I realized that you don't have to be "gamer" or a "tech savvy" person in order to work with information systems. Information systems are much more complex and interesting than I thought they would be. After learning basic HTML codes and working with different databases, I realized that MIS was the degree for me. I have developed an interest in data analytics and networks and find MIS very useful in business. I plan on declaring a double major in Marketing so that I am qualified to use my MIS skills in a specific field. I'm enjoying learning all there is to know about programming, information systems, and data analytics. I am excited for my future in MIS and look forward to working with everyone in ITM 352! </p>
