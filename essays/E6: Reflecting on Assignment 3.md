# E5: Reflecting on Assignment 3
**Briefly describe your system:** <br>
My Assignment 3 is an e-commerce application that I named Kaka'ako Surf Co. The store sells a variety of surfing essentials; surfboards, surfboard traction pads, surf leashes, and surf wax. My application allows users to select products, add the products to a shopping cart, edit the shopping cart, and purchase selected products. The application also provides a personalized user experience using sessions and cookies. 

**Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?** <br>
I was unable to create a functio that could successfully clear a user's cart.

**Describe what you are most proud of about your system:** <br>
I am most proud of my implementation of cookies to personalize a user's experience. I am also proud of the function I was able to modify to dynamically add products to the cart and display the amount of products being added without having to be redirected away from the products page.

**Describe what you are least happy with your system:** <br>
I am not entirely happy with the invoice and I wish I spent more time developing it and fixing any errors.

**How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?** <br>
Developing this assignment was different because it required much more time spent on planning. There were many times when I would find myself lost in my own assignment and have to refer back to my Assignment 3 PowerPoint Presentation to remember what I was trying to do. It was also very different because the user data personalization requirement. I believe that implementing this was the most challenging. 

**When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?** <br>
I spent a lot of time referring to the console, checking my server and my functions to make sure they were consistent, and carefully reading through my code. I also started to test code a few lines at a time, rather than just writing a lot of code before testing. This made development much easier. When I found myself hitting a mental block it would help to step away from the screen and reevaluate exactly what I was trying to accomplish. 

**Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?** <br>
I would say that my navbar and product pages were the most successful. I'm glad that I was able to develop a navbar function and only one products_display.html for all of my products. This made coding much easier and more efficient.

**Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?** <br>
My checkout.html and invoice emailing was the most difficult.

**What did you learn from doing this assignment?** <br>
I learned a lot about the coding process. I realized that the process I was following for Assignments 1 and 2 would not be efficient for Assignment 3. It is best to take your time and thoroughly understand every line of code being written.

**If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?** <br>
I would change the amount of time I dedicated to my checkout.html and invoice/mailer elements.

**Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging.** <br>
Thinking of how to do something = 20% <br>
Writing code = 40% <br>
Testing = 40%

**Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment** <br>
I completed Assignment3 individually. However, I did reach out to some of my classmates if I was uncertain about something. I also referenced online resources like W3 Schools and Stack Overflow.
