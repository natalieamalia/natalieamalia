# E3: Performing WODS Technical Essay
<p>
<ul>Introduction:
<br>
For the Invoice 2 WOD exercise we were asked to create an invoice for items using javascript and html. The invoice table had to have five items, their prices, quantities, extended prices, and the subtotal, tax, and total amount.</br>
Performance:
<br>
I began the WOD by reading all of the instructions on our class site. At first they were very intimidating, just like all of the other WOD instructions this semester. However, I have found that once I begin a WOD it is not as hard as I assumed. I began by following the instructions and attempting them on VS Code while I timed myself. After the first try, I realized that I was getting stuck on some certain and not finishing in time. I decided to watch the screencast and revisit what I had trouble with. I was able to find the solutions to my issues from the screencast and decided to try again. I was then able to complete the WOD in RX time of 20 minutes.</br>
Preparation:
<br>
To prepare for the WOD I opened VS code and followed the instructions. I read and reread the instructions thoroughly and tried to do my best on my own.</br>
Improvement:
<br>
I could have improved my preparation by researching tables and generating table rows in HTML, or defining variables, or making use of the find and replace feature. This would have helped me understand and complete the WOD faster.</br>
