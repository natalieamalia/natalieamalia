# E3: Performing WODS Technical Essay
<p>
<ul>Introduction:
<br>
For the Invoice 2 WOD exercise we were asked to create an invoice for items using javascript and html. The invoice table had to have five items, their prices, quantities, extended prices, and the subtotal, tax, and total amount.</br>
Performance:
<br>
I began the WOD by reading all of the instructions on our class site. At first they were very intimidating, just like all of the other WOD instructions this semester. However, I have found that once I begin a WOD it is not as hard as I assumed. I began by following the instructions and attempting them on VS Code while I timed myself. After a couple of tries, I realized that I was getting stuck on some parts and not finishing in time. I decided to watch the screencast and was able to find the solutions to my issues from the screencast. I tried once more after watching the screencast and was able to complete the WOD in 28 minutes. I then decided to record and was able to complete the WOD at an average time of 13 minutes.</br>
Preparation:
<br>
To prepare for the WOD I opened VS code and followed the instructions. I read and reread the instructions thoroughly and tried to do my best on my own.</br>
Improvement:
<br>
I could have improved my preparation by researching tables and generating table rows in HTML. This would have helped me understand and complete the WOD faster.</br>
