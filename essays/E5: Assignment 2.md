1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details:
<br>
<a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html">Assignment 2</a> included additional requirements and improvements to Assignment 1. Assignment 2 required the creation of a login and registration page for users, allowing multiple users to register and log in. It was required that user data was persistent, allowing the information entered in the registration form to be saved and used when verifying a user's login. Users were than redirected to an invoice page after passing the login or registration verification. Users should not have access to the application without a validated login. The application should also include personalized features for the user upon successful login.
<br>
2. What did you learn from this assignment?
<br>
Assignment 2 taught me many things. First, I learned how to fix my mistakes from Assignment 1. This was a very valuable lesson in itself. I learned how to code more efficiently, how to document my code more accurately, and how to improve everything from my previous assignment. I also learned about keeping data persistent and creating a customized application experiene with user personalization.
<br>
3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
<br>
I did not work with a partner.
<br>
4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
<br>
I asked classmates for help if I needed it. I learned to begin my next assignment earlier so that I can receive better help from a professor if needed.
<br>
5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
<br>
Developing this assignment consisted more of fixing and improving Assignment 1 then it did of creating a completely new assignment. It also had a lot to do with personalized data, which was different from Assignment 1.  This assignment had more to do with the server than the design and creation of the web application. I would say that the biggest challenge of Assignment 2 was making sure that all of the user data was saved correctly.
<br>
6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
<br>
I spent about two days thinking about how to approach the assignment and trying a few things, then I spent about a day writing code and another day testing it. In between these days I also worked on the assignment and searched for help from classmates and on the web.
<br>
7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
<br>
When I was working on Assignment 1 I was very shy and ashamed to ask for help. I’m glad I was able to ask for help and work more efficiently on this assignment. I also thought it was good that I spent time studying the labs and Assignment 1 in order to thoroughly understand the code that I was writing in Assignment 2.
<br>
8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
<br>
I would start earlier and seek more help earlier on in the process. Although I spent a lot of time on this assignment, I still felt as if I was rushing towards the end. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that there probably will never be enough time to work on an assignment.
