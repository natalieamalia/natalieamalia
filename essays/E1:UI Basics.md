# E1: UI Basics Technical Essay
<p>I was very overwhelmed after reading the instructions for BrowserHistory1. After the first few steps I began to have issues and my browser was not rendering the results I expected. I was confused as to how to approach the following steps, so I referred to the screencast solution. I listened to the screencast for direction and completed the WOD. I began recording the second attempt and felt more comfortable. It took me twenty minutes to complete.</p>
<p>I did not expect the BrowserHistory1 WOD process to take as long as it did. The entire process took me about an hour. Luckily, BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 took about twenty minutes each to complete. They were very refreshing compared to the first WOD. Browser History 2 was very easy and I completed the WOD in a little under seven minutes. Browser History 3 didn’t take very long, but it wasn’t as easy. I had issues with loading the Browser History 3 page in my browser. My code was correct but there was something wrong in my terminal. My VS Code also crashed during my first attempt. However, I was able to complete the WOD successfully after the second attempt. I also referred to the screencast for some style elements. The WODs this week were a good ITM352 learning experience.</p>
<p>I learned to take WODs seriously and set aside a good amount of time to complete them. I believe the WODs really improved the skills I have learned in this class so far. After multiple attempts, I felt very accomplished for being able to complete the WODs within AVG-RX time. I look forward to completing more WODs and continuing to develop my skills for ITM352!</p>
