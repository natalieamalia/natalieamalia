My name is Natalie and I am a Management and Information Systems student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Shidler College of Business. I have been familiar with MIS since I was a little girl but I never imagined that it would be the route for me. My dad graduated with a baccalaureate in Management Information Systems. He was a project manager and would get contracted to manage different software or development projects for companies and organizations. His jobs always seemed so advanced and high tech. I decided at a young age that I would appreciate a career that was more hands-on than one at a desk. My freshman year I planned to major in Psychology. I took economics as an elective and then decided that a business major would be more suitable for me. My sophomore year I was an exploratory business student. One of the prerequisites that I had to take was an Information and Computer Systems course. That course changed everything. After learning basic HTML codes and and working with different programs, I realized that MIS was the degree for me. My dream job is still one that is hands-on and social, maybe I'll even follow in the footsteps of my dad and become a project manager. I know MIS will help me get there and I'm so excited to start my MIS journey!
