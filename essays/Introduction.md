# Introduction

My name is Natalie and I am an MIS and Finance student at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa College of Business. I have been familiar with MIS since I was a little girl but I never imagined that it would be the career route for me. My dad graduated with a baccalaureate in Management Information Systems. He was a project manager and would get contracted to manage different software or development projects for companies and organizations. His job always seemed so advanced and high tech to me. I would not say I am a very tech-savvy person, but as I grew up I began to realize how useful and interesting computers are and how resourceful it is to have an understanding of information systems. In my sophomore year of college I was an exploratory business student. One of the prerequisites that I had to take was an Information and Computer Systems course. This course was very eye-opening for me and really sparked my interest in information systems. After learning basic HTML codes and and working with different programs, I realized that MIS was the degree for me. I'm not sure what my dream job in MIS is yet, but I'm sure I'll find it along the way. For now I'm just enjoying learning all there is to know about MIS. Who knows, maybe I'll even follow in the footsteps of my dad and become a project manager. I know MIS will help me get there and I'm so excited to start my MIS journey!
